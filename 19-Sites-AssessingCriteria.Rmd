# Sites: Assessing criteria

Start SECTION: With final output from findSite()

[CONSIDER: Also provide option to start section with outputs from seaward extension methods]

Write rules to assess data against KBA criteria.

[See example code from India IBA work]

Create output that prepares data in format required for entering in WDKBA.

CAVEAT: This assumes you are only assessing one dataGroup against KBA criteria and only consider that data for a potential KBA.

It DOES NOT account for how you identify a global KBA where you need to consider multiple overlapping element layers (e.g. overlapping layers from different species but all in slightly different places - and how you would delineate a final KBA boundary).
