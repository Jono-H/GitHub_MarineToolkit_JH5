Start SECTION: With final output from findSite()

[CONSIDER: Also provide option to start section with outputs from seaward extension methods]

Showcase:
- Dropping small polygons
- Filling holes in polygons
- Merging polygons
- Simplifying boundaries (smooth / minimum convex polygon)

Depending on simplification, showcase:
