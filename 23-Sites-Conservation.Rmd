# Sites: Conservation

Text to be developed

What you can do with different data layers:

- general outputs (incl. sites not meeting KBA criteria)
- dataGroup layers meeting KBA criteria
- Global KBA layers

How you can consider conservation actions for species using these layers. i.e. actions against threats (Dias et al. 2019).

NOTE: Context of spatial scales of conservation (Boyd / Oppel)

Need to define limitations of suggested conservation actions.

Showcase: different data layers that can be used to help identify potential threats and where these might be acting on species.
